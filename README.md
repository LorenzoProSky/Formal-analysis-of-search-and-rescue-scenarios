Final project for the MSc course *Formal Methods for Concurrent and Real-Time Systems* a.y. 23/24 at *Politecnico di Milano*.\

**UPPAAL model** for search and rescue of civilians during an emergency, carried out by trained professional assisted by autonomous drones.\

This document presents the developed models (both non-stochastic and stochastic), the design choices behind them, meaningful properties and their formal verifications, with the final objective of highlighting strengths and weaknesses.
